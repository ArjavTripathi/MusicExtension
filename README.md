This is a [Plasmo extension](https://docs.plasmo.com/) project bootstrapped with [`plasmo init`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/plasmo).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
# or
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and load the appropriate development build. For example, if you are developing for the chrome browser, using manifest v3, use: `build/chrome-mv3-dev`.

You can start editing the popup by modifying `popup.tsx`. It should auto-update as you make changes. To add an options page, simply add a `options.tsx` file to the root of the project, with a react component default exported. Likewise to add a content page, add a `content.ts` file to the root of the project, importing some module and do some logic, then reload the extension on your browser.

For further guidance, [visit our Documentation](https://docs.plasmo.com/)

## Making production build

Run the following:

```bash
pnpm build
# or
npm run build
```

This should create a production bundle for your extension, ready to be zipped and published to the stores.

## Submit to the webstores

The easiest way to deploy your Plasmo extension is to use the built-in [bpp](https://bpp.browser.market) GitHub action. Prior to using this action however, make sure to build your extension and upload the first version to the store to establish the basic credentials. Then, simply follow [this setup instruction](https://docs.plasmo.com/framework/workflows/submit) and you should be on your way for automated submission!

## Remaining Work Before Open-Sourcing

- [ ] Implement each of the four starting services with browser-only logic.
- [ ] Centralize browser-based matching logic like it's done in TranslationService.
- [ ] Refactor into modular service classes. This includes merging Playback and Link controllers into one class or configuration, removing each of the content script entries - instead create on content script for all music services with \* matching and dynamically set each one up based on configurations.
- [ ] Clean up observer pattern as it's too coupled.
- [ ] Add SDK-like functions for controlling the mini player from observers and elsewhere.
- [ ] Create better separations in contexts.
