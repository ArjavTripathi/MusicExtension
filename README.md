<h2 id="about">About</h2>

SynQ is a browser extension for Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge that aims to make your music listening experience on the web better. The features of SynQ include:

üéµ **Multi-Platform Integration**: SynQ supports Apple Music, Amazon Music, and YouTube Music, with more to come!

üîó **Cross-Platform Link Redirects**: When you receive a link to a track, album, or artist on a music service that's not your preferred one, SynQ ensures you can quickly redirect to your favorite service without missing a beat.

‚öôÔ∏è **Comprehensive Controls**: Easily control your music with a full set of playback options including play/pause, next, previous, volume adjustment, repeat options, and like/dislike buttons ‚Äì all conveniently accessible in a compact mini player.

üîÑ **Queue Playback**: View your upcoming tracks and play anything currently in your queue without having to go to your music service UI.

üîä **Floating Mode**: Take your music anywhere on the web with the floating/always-on-top mode. Enjoy the freedom to keep your mini player on top of other windows for an uninterrupted music journey.

üéâ **Notifications**: Stay in the know! SynQ notifies you instantly when the song changes, ensuring you're always aware of the music playing in the background.

‚å®Ô∏è **Key Controls**: Effortlessly control your music with added keyboard shortcuts integrated directly into the mini player.
